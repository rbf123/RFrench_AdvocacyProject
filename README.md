# The Little Lunch Buddy Volunteer Project 

ðŸ™‚ The Little Lunch Buddy Volunteer Project is an informational website created as a social advocacy project.\
ðŸ”— Website Link: https://rbf123.github.io/RFrench_AdvocacyProject/

It is a one-page website that is fully styled and responsive on an activism topic that I care about - educational equity.
Created using HTML, CSS and Javascript, this project was created while I was attending CodePath's Spring 2024 WebDev101 class. 

Website Features:
- Information about the topic of educational equity: the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic to students, what is learning loss, how volunteer tutoring can bridge that learning gap, resources for students and volunteers to organizations that help through tutoring online and in person, how to find more info online about communities local to you, and how to donate to local classrooms.
- Sign up form with info & email validation, with a counter that updates number of signatures with signer's name and location 
- Pop up modal with Javascript animation after signing up, with a customized shoutout using signer's name & location info
- Dark Mode button
- Reduce Motion button to stop scroll animation
- Related news articles showing information about the knowledge gap from Covid & how tutoring can help
- Interactive map of the USA featuring the ten most populated states with hover function, linked to resources at the relevant part of the website for users to access resources and information. (example: clicking Texas on the map will take you to the resources available in Texas)

Future improvements:
Add volunteering & tutoring information for the other states within the USA, and update the SVG container to include pathing and hover animation for the added states, add a feature that auto-updates the news articles section with the latest related news
